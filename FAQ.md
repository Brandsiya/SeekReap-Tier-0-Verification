# SeekReap Tier 0 – Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Tier 0?
Tier 0 is the **frozen, source-available CLI foundation** of SeekReap. It establishes deterministic structure and boundaries, not verification.

## Is Tier 0 production-ready?
**No.** Tier 0 is non-production, CLI-only, and local-only. It is a declarative foundation, not an operational system.

## Is Tier 0 open source?
Tier 0 is **source-available**, not OSI-approved open source. See the `SEEKREAP-TIER0-FROZEN-LICENSE` file for exact terms.

## Can I integrate Tier 0 into my product?
**No.** Tier 0 does not support runtime integration, APIs, or SDKs. It is a boundary definition, not an integration surface.

## Where is the verification engine?
Verification begins in **Tier 1**, which is **not part of this repository**. Tier 0 defines *what* verification means; Tier 1 defines *how* it is executed.

## Can I request features?
**Tier 0 does not accept feature requests.** Such requests will be closed or redirected to the appropriate channel.

## I'm an investor / company / advertiser. What now?
Tier 0 is **not commercial**. All commercial and strategic discussions relate to **Tier 1+**.

## How do I get started with SeekReap?
1. Review the `MASTER_INDEX.md` for canonical documentation
2. Run `./verify_tier0.sh` to verify your environment
3. Use the CLI (`node cli.js --help`) to explore declarative patterns
4. For operational verification, await Tier 1

## Why is Tier 0 frozen?
Freezing Tier 0 ensures a **stable, deterministic foundation** that cannot be compromised by feature creep. This protects the integrity of the entire SeekReap ecosystem.
