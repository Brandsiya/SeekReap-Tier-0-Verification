# Frequently Asked Questions (Tier 0)

## General Questions

### Q: What is Tier 0?
**A**: Tier 0 is the frozen specification and governance layer of the SeekReap verification system. It defines the boundaries, rules, and canonical documentation that all other tiers must follow.

### Q: Why is Tier 0 frozen?
**A**: Tier 0 is frozen to provide a stable, unchanging foundation. This ensures:
- Consistent governance boundaries
- Predictable evolution paths
- Clear separation between specification and implementation
- Reliable reference documentation

### Q: Can I modify Tier 0?
**A**: No, Tier 0 is permanently frozen. Only administrative changes (typos, broken links) are permitted. All substantive development occurs in Tier 1 and beyond.

## Usage Questions

### Q: How do I use Tier 0?
**A**: Tier 0 serves as:
1. **Reference documentation** - for understanding the system architecture
2. **Governance boundary** - defines what can and cannot change
3. **Implementation guide** - frozen examples show proper patterns
4. **Evolution roadmap** - shows how the system will grow

### Q: Can I copy these patterns for my own project?
**A**: Yes, following the license terms. The patterns and documentation are designed to be reusable reference implementations.

### Q: How do I contribute to SeekReap?
**A**: Contribute to Tier 1+ repositories. Tier 0 is for reference only.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What's in the examples/ directory?
**A**: Frozen canonical examples that demonstrate:
- Basic verification patterns
- Advanced implementation approaches
- Governance boundary examples

### Q: Why are there CLI tools in a frozen repository?
**A**: The CLI tools (`cli.js`, `verify_tier0.sh`) are **frozen reference implementations**. They demonstrate how Tier 0 concepts should be implemented, but are not for active use.

### Q: What license applies?
**A**: Tier 0 uses a custom "Frozen Foundation License" that allows reference and implementation but prohibits modification of the frozen foundation.

## Tier Relationship Questions

### Q: How does Tier 0 relate to Tier 1?
**A**: 
- **Tier 0**: Frozen specification (WHAT the system is)
- **Tier 1**: Active implementation (HOW the system works)
- All Tier 1 code must respect Tier 0 boundaries

### Q: What happens if Tier 0 needs updating?
**A**: Tier 0 doesn't get updated. Instead:
1. New patterns go to Tier 1+
2. Evolution happens in higher tiers
3. Tier 0 remains as historical foundation
