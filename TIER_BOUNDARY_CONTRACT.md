# Tier Boundary Contract

## Purpose

This document defines the **formal boundary** between SeekReap Tier 0 and all higher tiers.

The boundary is absolute.

---

## Tier 0 Responsibilities

Tier 0 is responsible for:
- Defining protocol invariants
- Establishing semantic meaning
- Constraining authority
- Declaring immutability

Tier 0 does not execute, enforce, or validate.

---

## Tier 1+ Responsibilities

Tier 1 and above are responsible for:
- Implementing Tier-0 specifications
- Providing execution and tooling
- Managing evolution and iteration
- Handling commercial and operational concerns

---

## Prohibited Crossings

The following are prohibited in Tier 0:

- Implementation logic
- Performance claims
- Security guarantees tied to code
- Market or competitive constraints
- Contribution processes

Conversely, higher tiers may not:
- Redefine Tier-0 terms
- Override Tier-0 invariants
- Fork or mutate Tier-0 documents

---

## Authority Rule

Tier 0 defines authority.  
It does not exercise authority.

All enforcement mechanisms live above this boundary.
