# Reference Implementations

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT GOVERNANCE BOUNDARY
These files are **FROZEN REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS ONLY**.  
They demonstrate HOW Tier 0 specifications can be implemented in practice.

## What This Is
- Example implementations of Tier 0 patterns
- Frozen demonstration code
- Reference for Tier 1+ implementers
- NOT part of canonical Tier 0 specification

## What This Is NOT
- Not active development code
- Not required for Tier 0 compliance  
- Not specification documentation
- Not build tools for Tier 0

## Files
1. `cli.js` - Example CLI interface implementation
2. `package.json` - Example Node.js configuration
3. `test.js` - Example test suite implementation  
4. `verify_tier0.sh` - Example verification script

## Usage
Study these as examples of proper Tier 0 pattern implementation.
Do NOT modify them - they are permanently frozen.
For active development, see Tier 1+ repositories.
