# Tier 0 Examples

## PURPOSE
Example structure showing the verification pattern.

## IMPORTANT
These are **declarative examples only**.
Actual verification happens in Tier 1+.

## STRUCTURE
\`\`\`
policy.json    # Policy declaration format
evidence.json  # Evidence declaration format
\`\`\`

## USAGE (DECLARATIVE)
\`\`\`bash
# Tier 0: Only declares the pattern
# Tier 1+: Implements actual verification
\`\`\`

## BOUNDARY
Tier 0 declares WHAT verification should look like.
Tier 1+ implements HOW verification works.
