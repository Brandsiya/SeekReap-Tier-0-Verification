# PHASE 3 - CYCLE 1: AUDIT INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVATION
## Status: ACTIVE
## Date: 2026-01-06
## Governance: BINDING

## OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED:
Activated SeekReap's audit infrastructure to produce regulator-grade, 
immutable compliance evidence without altering Phase 2 behavior.

## IMPLEMENTATION:
- **Append-only audit store** (filesystem-based, tamper-evident)
- **Cryptographic integrity proof** (SHA-256 hashing)
- **Canonical audit schema** (contractually defensible)
- **Non-invasive Phase 2 integration** (wrapper pattern)

## MONETIZATION UNLOCKED:
✅ "SeekReap produces independent, regulator-grade compliance evidence."

## CONTRACTUAL READINESS:
- Proof-of-execution records: ✅
- Immutable evidence trail: ✅
- Time-bound verification: ✅
- Platform liability shield: ✅

## NEXT CYCLE GATE:
Cycle 1 must pass all success criteria before Cycle 2 (Query API) can be considered.

## VERIFICATION COMMAND:
./audit/cycle1_validator.sh
