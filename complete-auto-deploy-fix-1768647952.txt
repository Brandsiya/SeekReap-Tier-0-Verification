================================
Test Time: $(date)

ISSUES DIAGNOSED:
1. 'Master' branch: Auto-deploy triggered but deployment failed
2. 'master' branch: Deployment passes but auto-deploy doesn't trigger

ROOT CAUSES:
1. Build/deploy issues with uppercase branch names
2. Webhook/configuration mismatch after branch rename

EXPECTED AFTER FIX:
 Auto-deploy TRIGGERS for 'master' pushes
 Deployment SUCCEEDS (builds and runs)
 Complete platform unity achieved!

TEST SCENARIO:
1. Push this file to 'master' branch
2. Render webhook should trigger within 60s
3. Deployment should start and SUCCEED
4. This file should appear in production
