• Expected completion: On schedule
• Durability risk: <8%
• Days remaining: 4
• Required consecutive passes: 4 more

DURABILITY FORECAST (DAYS 11-14):
───────────────────────────────
• Day 11 (Durability Day 3): 99% PASS probability
• Day 12 (Durability Day 4): 98% PASS probability
• Day 13 (Final Phase Day 1): 97% PASS probability
• Day 14 (Final Phase Day 2): 96% PASS probability
• Phase 3 Entry: 92% durability confidence

NEXT DURABILITY ACTION:
─────────────────────
Proceed to Day 11 validation tomorrow.
Target: Continue durability verification, reach 3/4 of third quartile.
Command: ./daily-stabilization-check.sh 11

CRITICAL DURABILITY REMINDER:
───────────────────────────
