# SeekReap Tier 0 Freeze Announcement 🚀

**Status:** Tier 0 — FROZEN  
**Version:** 1.1.0  
**License:** SEEKREAP-TIER0-FROZEN-LICENSE  
**Canonical Files:** 13

## Overview
SeekReap Tier 0 is now **officially frozen** as a purely declarative, Reference-Only Protocol.

This tier represents a **stable, immutable foundation** for the SeekReap verification ecosystem. It is:
- CLI-only
- Deterministic (no timestamps)
- Local execution only
- Non-deployable (no cloud, hosting, or network exposure)
- Source-available under the Tier 0 license

## What This Freeze Means
- **No further changes** to Tier 0 interface or files.
- **No SDKs, APIs, or dashboards.**
- Ensures a **deterministic foundation** for the Tier 1 verification engine.
- Protects against **scope creep or deployment artifacts.**

## Next Steps
- Tier 1 will introduce the **verification engine** and optional cloud integration.
- Future tiers will add dashboards, SDKs, and extensions.
- All Tier 0 canonical files remain untouched and authoritative.

 Tier 0 is frozen. Ready for Tier 1 evolution.
