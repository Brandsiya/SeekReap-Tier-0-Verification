# SeekReap Tier 0 Freeze Announcement

**Status:** Tier 0 — Frozen

SeekReap Tier 0 is now officially frozen.

Tier 0 represents the OSS Pilot foundation of SeekReap: a declarative, CLI-only, source-available baseline that defines system intent, boundaries, and evolution constraints.

**This freeze is intentional and strategic.**

## What Tier 0 Is
Tier 0 exists to:
- Declare verification intent deterministically
- Establish immutable system boundaries
- Provide a transparent, inspectable foundation
- Prevent scope creep at the foundational layer
- Enable clean evolution into Tier 1+

Tier 0 is not a product, not a service, and not a verification engine.

## What Tier 0 Is Not
Tier 0 explicitly excludes:
- Cloud hosting or deployment
- Network calls or telemetry
- Verification engines
- APIs or SDKs
- UI dashboards
- Commercial usage

Any of the above belongs to Tier 1 and beyond.

## License Clarification
Tier 0 is source-available, not OSI-approved open source.

The source is provided for inspection, learning, and local execution only.

Commercial use, hosted services, or derivative verification products require separate licensing.

This model ensures a stable, immutable foundation while protecting the integrity of future tiers.

## What Happens Next
With Tier 0 frozen:
- Documentation is now canonical
- Interfaces are immutable
- Backward compatibility is guaranteed
- Tier 1 development can proceed cleanly

Tier 1 will introduce managed verification capabilities under a separate repository and license model.

## Thank You
Tier 0 exists because of careful design, not speed.

Freezing it now ensures SeekReap can grow without breaking trust later.
